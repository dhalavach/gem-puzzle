    <h3>THE ZOO HAS OFFICIALLY REOPENED BUT WE STILL NEED YOUR HELP!</h3>
    <p>Even though the Zoo has been able to reopen, we are at a greatly reduced capacity with educational programs and
        public and private events cancelled or postponed for additional months. We need you now more than ever to help
        ensure that we overcome these challenges. We have been actively raising funds in the community, and we are
        grateful for the generosity. But much more support is still needed, and we need your help! Please consider a
        gift today – no matter what size – to help us sustain our mission.</p>
